THE FUNCTION CHALLENGE + GIT
----------------------------
For this assignment, you will need to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The HTML only need to have a header that reads "Function Challenge" with just a little styling in the CSS. Then, create a function in the Javascript that console logs out "Hey this works!". Then you will need to check in the project into a personal GitHub repo (Note: NOT GitHub pages).

Use the following naming conventions for your files and repository:

HTML file - "index.html"
CSS file - "styles.css"
JavaScript file - "script.js"
GitHub repo - "prime_prestudy_01".
The goal of this assignment is to prove that you have a handle on how all of the pages 'link' together and that you can get a project posted to GitHub.
